## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

In this project I focused on Flexbox usage to be more fluent in it. Also, working with svg files and make it behave how I want is always interesting, so everytime I encounter it in projects and successfully make everything work is satisfying.

### Continued development

This project was built after the one I already published, so I focused on things I learned and experienced from another projects like accessibility or clean code.
